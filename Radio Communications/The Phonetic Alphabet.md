# The Phonetic Alphabet

---

The phonetic alphabet provides a standardized method of communicating voice messages by radio or telephone, regardless of any language differences or quality of the communication channel. Pilots and ATC facilities use the phonetic alphabets when communicating to reduce confusion of similar sounding letters, words, and numbers.

## A Brief Look At Why It Exists

The phonetic alphabet, officially designated as the International Radiotelephony Spelling Alphabet, and also referred to as the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) phonetic alphabet, is the most widely used radiotelephone spelling alphabet. It was adopted in the early 1930s and have changed slightly overtime to accommodate many uses.

The FAA's main use of the phonetic alphabet is to ease the communication of information when adverse communications conditions exist, such as poor frequency quality or frequency congestion.

All pilots should be familiar with the phonetic alphabets in order to communicate effectively with ATC facilities. ATC will expect their use when identifying an aircraft during initial contact, when aircraft with similar sounding identification are receiving communications on the same frequency, and to spell out groups of letters or difficult words.



## The Basics

The phonetic alphabet's strength is that each letter and number has a distinct pronunciation. This makes it nearly impossible to confuse letters that originally sound similar like "B" and "D" or words like "Pan" and "Land." Numbers are also treated the same to avoid communication barriers between different languages. For example, the number 9 may be misinterpreted as "NO" to a person whose native language is German.

_The table below indicates the proper way to pronounce each character._

Character | Telephony | Phonic <br />(Pronunciation)
------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
A | Alfa | (AL-FAH)
B | Bravo | (BRAH-VOH)
C | Charlie | (CHAR-LEE) or (SHAR-LEE)
D | Delta | (DELL-TAH)
E | Echo | (ECK-OH)
F | Foxtrot | (FOKS-TROT)
G | Golf | (GOLF)
H | Hotel | (HOH-TEL)
I | India | (IN-DEE-AH)
J | Juliett | (JEW-LEE-ETT)
K | Kilo | (KEY-LOH)
L | Lima | (LEE-MAH)
M | Mike | (MIKE)
N | November | (NO-VEM-BER)
O | Oscar | (OSS-CAH)
P | Papa | (PAH-PAH)
Q | Quebec | (KEH-BECK)
R | Romeo | (ROW-ME-OH)
S | Sierra | (SEE-AIR-RAH)
T | Tango | (TANG-GO)
U | Uniform | (YOU-NEE-FORM) or (OO-NEE-FORM)
V | Victor | (VIK-TAH)
W | Whiskey | (WISS-KEY)
X | Xray | (ECKS-RAY)
Y | Yankee | (YANG-KEY)
Z | Zulu | (ZOO-LOO)
1 | One | (WUN)
2 | Two | (TOO)
3 | Three | (TREE)
4 | Four | (FOW-ER)
5 | Five | (FIFE)
6 | Six | (SIX)
7 | Seven | (SEV-EN)
8 | Eight | (AIT)
9 | Nine | (NIN-ER)
0 | Zero | (ZEE-RO)



## Saying Figures

When communicating round figures that indicate hundreds and thousands, such as those for ceiling heights, and upper wind levels state the separate digits of the thousands plus the hundreds if appropriate.

All other figures like airways and jet routes must be transmitted by pronouncing each digit. For example, if stating an aircraft callsign or repeating instructions that include figures.

For figures that contain decimals like a radio frequency, the decimal point is spoken as "point."

**Note:** _ICAO procedures require the decimal point be spoken as "decimal." The FAA will honor such usage by military aircraft and all other aircraft required to use ICAO procedures._

_Example: Communication Figures_

Example | Speech
-------- | -------- |
500 | five hundred
3,500 | three thousand five hundred
10,000 | one zero thousand
V12 | Victor Twelve
J533 | J Five Thirty-Three
18 | one eight
121.9 | one two one point niner
N35281 | november three five two eight one



## Saying Altitudes and Flight Levels

Indicating altitudes and flight levels are very similar to saying numbers. For altitudes up to but not including 18,000 feet MSL, state the separate digits of the thousands plus the hundreds if appropriate. At and above 18,000 feet MSL (FL180), state the words "flight level" followed by the separate digits of the flight level.

_Example: Communicating Altitudes and Flight Levels_

Example | Speech
-------- | -------- |
1,500 | one thousand five hundred
8,000 | eight thousand
12,000 | one two thousand
14,500 | one four thousand five hundred
FL190 | Flight Level One Niner Zero
FL245 | Flight Level Two Four Five



## Saying Directions

When transmitting directions over a radio frequency, standard procedure is that all three digits relating to bearing, course, heading, or wind direction always be reference in relation to magnetic north. If necessary to communicate information in relation to true north, the word "true" must be added where applicable.

_Example: Communicating Directions_

Example | Speech
-------- | -------- |
08 (Runway) | runway zero eight
270 (Magnetic Course) | two seven zero
090 (True Course) | zero niner zero true
340 (Magnetic Heading) | heading three four zero
220 (Wind Direction) | wind two two zero



## Saying Speeds

Transmitting speeds are also similar to transmitting standard numbers. The separate digits of the speed followed by the word "knots" should be communicated. Controllers may omit the word "knots" when using terminology that already indicates that the controller is referring to speed instructions or procedures. For example, "reduce/increase speed to one two zero."

When referring to Mach numbers, the word "Mach" (pronounced "mahk"), should precede the numbers.

_Example: Communicating Speeds_

Example | Speech
-------- | -------- |
120 knots | one two zero knots
250 knots | two five zero knots
1.5 (Mach number) | Mach one point five
0.64 (Mach number) | Mach point six four



## Saying Time

The FAA uses Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) for all operations. The word "local" or the time zone equivalent must be used to denote local when local time is given during radio and telephone communications. The term "Zulu" may be used to denote UTC.

_Standard Time to Coordinated Universal Time_

Time Zone | Conversion
-------- | -------- |
Eastern Standard Time | Add 5 hours
Central Standard Time | Add 6 hours
Mountain Standard Time | Add 7 hours
Pacific Standard Time | Add 8 hours
Alaska Standard Time | Add 9 hours
Hawaii Standard Time | Add 10 hours

**Note:** _For daylight time, subtract 1 hour_

References may be made to local daylight or standard time utilizing the 24-hour clock system. When this is used, the first two figures indicate the hour, and minutes are indicated by the last two figures. Time may also be stated in minutes only by using two figures.

Current time in use at a station is stated in the nearest quarter minute in order that pilots may use this information for time checks. Fractions of a quarter minute less than 8 seconds are stated as the preceding quarter minute; fraction of a quarter minute of 8 seconds or more are stated as the succeeding quarter minutes.

_Example: Communicating Time_

Example | Speech
-------- | -------- |
0920 UTC | zero niner two zero<br />zero one two zero Pacific or local<br />one twenty AM
0830 | zero eight three zero
0000 | zero zero zero zero
0929:05 | zero niner two niner
0929:10 | zero niner two niner and one-quarter



### Tips

- When transmitting to an ATC facility, always use standard phraseology and proper pronunciation of the phonetic alphabets.
- All aircraft call signs should be said using the phonetic alphabets.
- If you find it difficult to speak fluently using the phonetic alphabets, practice spelling common words that you see throughout the day using the phonetic alphabets.
- Never assume instructions if you are not clear what those instructions were. Always copy and readback all ATC instructions.



### Federal Aviation Regulations

- <span class="badge-warning font-w700 px-1">&#167; 91.123(a)</span> Compliance with ATC clearances and instructions. When an ATC clearance has been obtained, no pilot in command may deviate from that clearance unless an amended clearance is obtained, an emergency exists, or the deviation is in response to a traffic alert and collision avoidance system resolution advisory... When a pilot is uncertain of an ATC clearance, that pilot shall immediately request clarification from ATC.
