# Basics of Weather Charts

---

Aviation weather charts are graphic charts that depict current or forecast weather. They provide an overall picture of the United States and should be used in the beginning stages of flight planning. Typically, weather charts show the movement of major weather systems and fronts making them very helpful tools for pilots.

## Station Models and Chart Symbols

In meteorology, station models are symbolic chart illustrations that provide a snapshot of weather at a given reporting station. Station models are meant to show the most important elements of weather. Various reporting points across the United States provide surface weather observations. Each reporting point consists of:
  - Weather (Present)
  - Wind
  - Sea-level Pressure
  - Pressure Trend
  - Sky Cover
  - Temperature
  - Dew Point

**Weather (Present)** - A weather symbol is plotted if at the time of observation, there is either precipitation occurring or a condition causing reduced visibility. Over 100 different standard weather symbols exists and are used to describe the current weather.

**Wind** - Wind is given in true direction of wind and is plotted in increments of 5 knots, with the outer end of the symbol pointing toward the direction from which the wind is blowing. The wind speed is determined by adding up the total of flags, lines (commonly referred to as barbs), and half-lines, each of which have the following individual values:
  - Flag: 50 knots
  - Line: 10 knots
  - Half-Line: 5 knots

If there is only a circle depicted over the station with no wind symbol present, the wind is calm.

**Sea-level Pressure** - Sea-level pressure is given in three digits to the nearest tenth of a millibar (mb). For 1,000 mbs or greater, prefix a 10 to the three digits. For less than 1,000 mbs, prefix a 9 to the three digits. For example, "103" would indicate a sea-level pressure of 1013 mb, which is equivalent to 29.92 inches of mercury. While "872" would indicate pressure of 987.2 mb, the equivalent of 29.15 inches of mercury.

**Pressure Trend** - The pressure trend has two components, a number and symbol, to indicate how the sea-level pressure has changed during the past three hours. The number provides the 3-hour change in tenths of millibars, while the symbol provides a graphic illustration of how this change occurred.

**Sky Cover** - Total sky cover is depicted as a circle at the center of the station plot and is filled according to the sky covered with clouds. Sky cover ranges from clear, scattered, broken, overcast, or obscured/partially obscured.

**Temperature** - given in degrees Fahrenheit.

**Dew Point** - given in degree Fahrenheit.



## Radar Summary Chart

![Radar Summary Chart Example](https://studentpilotportal.com/photos/learn/radar_summary.png)

Probably the most common, the radar summary chart depicts location, size, shape, and intensity of precipitation, as well as the direction of cell movement. The chart shows lines and cells of hazardous thunderstorms as well as heights of the tops and bases of precipitation areas. These charts are an ideal preflight planning, but has its drawbacks since it only detects precipitation - it does not detect all cloud formation.



## Surface Analysis Chart

![Surface Analysis Chart Example](https://studentpilotportal.com/photos/learn/surface-analysis-chart.png)

The surface analysis chart depicts an analysis of the current surface weather. This chart is transmitted every 3 hours and covers the contiguous 48 states and adjacent areas. A surface analysis chart shows the areas of high and low pressure, fronts, temperatures, dew points, wind directions and speeds, local weather, and visual obstructions.



## Weather Depiction Chart

![Weather Depiction Chart](https://studentpilotportal.com/photos/learn/weather_depiction.png)

A weather depiction chart details surface conditions as derived from METAR and other surface observations. The weather depiction chart is prepared and transmitted by
computer every 3 hours beginning at 0100Z time and is valid data for the forecast period. It is designed to be used for flight planning by giving an overall picture of the weather across the United States.

Weather depiction chart also provides a graphic display of IFR, VFR, and marginal VFR (MVFR) weather.
  - Areas of IFR conditions (ceilings less than 1,000 feet and visibility less than three miles) are shown by a hatched area outlined by a smooth line.
  - MVFR regions (ceilings 1,000 to 3,000 feet, visibility 3 to 5 miles) are shown by a nonhatched area outlined by a smooth line.
  - Areas of VFR (no ceiling or ceiling greater than 3,000 feet and visibility greater than five miles) are not outlined.

Also plotted are fronts, troughs, and squall lines from the previous hours surface analysis chart. Weather depiction charts show a modified station model that provides sky conditions in the form of total sky cover, ceiling height, weather, and obstructions to visibility, but does not include winds or pressure readings like the surface analysis chart. A bracket ( ] ) symbol to the right of the station indicates the observation was made by an automated station.



## Significant Weather Prognostic Charts

![Significant Weather Prognostic Chart Example](https://studentpilotportal.com/photos/learn/progchart.png)

_The example above shows a low-level surface prognostic chart_

Significant weather prognostic charts are a four-panel chart that show forecasts of aviation weather hazards. These charts include low-level significant weather from surface to FL240 and high-level significant weather from FL250 to FL630. Each chart is divided on the left and right into 12 and 24 hour forecast intervals. Pilots use these charts to evaluate existing and potential weather hazards they may encounter throughout a flight. Both low and high-level charts are issued four times daily and are valid at fixed times: 0000, 0600, 1200, and 1800 UTC. Forecasts cover the 48 contiguous states, southern Canada and the coastal waters for altitudes below 24,000 ft.

The low-level chart is primarily intended to be used as a guidance product for briefing the VFR pilot. It depicts precipitation, freezing levels, turbulence (moderate or greater), and low cloud ceilings and/or restrictions to visibility (shown as contoured areas of MVFR and IFR conditions). Examples of restrictions to visibility include widespread dust storms, sandstorms, and volcanic ash.

The high-level chart is primarily intended for IFR pilots. It is an enhanced surface chart that includes fronts, pressure, precipitation type, precipitation intensity, and weather type. Areas of precipitation are depicted green by shaded green areas. This chart can be used to determine where thunderstorms and tropical cyclone activity, squall lines, tropopause height, and the location of jet streams.

Also available are the 36 and 48-hour significant weather prognostic chart, which is an extension of the 12 and 24-hour forecast. This chart is issued twice a day. It typically contains forecast positions and characteristics of pressure patterns, fronts, and precipitation.



### Tips

- Use a combination of weather charts to get a full overview of the current and forecast weather for both departure and arrival airports, as well as enroute.
- Pilots should balance weather phenomena with their aircraft capability and skill set resulting in aeronautical decision-making appropriate to the flight.
- Prognostic charts are an excellent source of information for preflight planning;
however, this chart should be viewed in light of current conditions and specific local area forecasts.
- The Radar Summary Chart only shows areas of precipitation and does not show cloud formation or fog. No echoes does not imply clear weather.
