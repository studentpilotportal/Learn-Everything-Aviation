# Basics of Weather Charts

---

Aviation weather charts are a very helpful tool for all pilots. They provide an overall picture of the United States and should be used in the beginning stages of flight planning. Typically, weather charts show the movement of major weather systems and fronts.

## Surface Analysis Chart

![Surface Analysis Chart Example](https://studentpilotportal.com/photos/learn/surface-analysis-chart.png)

Surface Analysis Charts provide a picture of atmospheric pressure patterns at the Earth's surface. Locations of high and low-pressure systems associated with fronts can also be seen on these charts. Weather conditions shown are valid in the time zone of the chart, which is also transmitted every three hours. Above shows an example of a Surface Analysis Chart.



## Radar Summary Chart

![Radar Summary Chart Example](https://studentpilotportal.com/photos/learn/radar_summary.png)

The Radar Summary Chart depicts location, size, shape, and intensity of precipitation, as well as the direction of cell movement. The chart shows lines and cells of hazardous thunderstorms as well as heights of the tops and bases of precipitation areas. Although these charts are an ideal preflight planning tool, it has its drawbacks. Because radar only detects precipitation, it does not detect all cloud formation.



## Significant Weather Prognostic Chart

![Significant Weather Prognostic Chart Example](https://studentpilotportal.com/photos/learn/progchart.png)

A four-panel presentation which compares different times. 12 hours forecast are on the left and the 24-hour forecast on the right. These charts are designed to help you plan flights to avoid areas of low visibilities and ceilings as well as areas where turbulence and icing may exist. Mid and high-level prognostic charts cover 10,000 feet MSL to FL450. The high-level chart covers altitudes from FL250 to FL630, which forecast of thunderstorms, tropical cyclone, squall lines, moderate to greater turbulence, widespread dust storms and sandstorms, tropopause height, the location of jet streams, and volcanic activity. The example above shows a low-level Significant Weather Prognostic Chart.



## Weather Depiction Chart

![Weather Depiction Chart](https://studentpilotportal.com/photos/learn/weather_depiction.png)

A graphical METAR that provides surface conditions and other surface observations. It is generated every 3 hours beginning at 0100Z and is valid at the time of the plotted data. Weather Depiction Charts are used for flight planning to give pilots an overall picture of the weather across the US.



### Tips

- Use a combination of weather charts to get a full overview of the current and forecast weather for both departure and arrival airports, as well as enroute.



### Federal Aviation Regulations

- <span class="badge-warning font-w700 px-1">&#167; 91.155</span> No person may operate an aircraft under VFR when the flight visibility is less or at a distance prescribed for basic VFR weather minimums.
