# Aviation Forecasts

---

Observed weather condition reports are often used in the creation of forecasts for the same area. Many forecast products exist to aid pilots in flight training. Pilots need to be familiar with terminal aerodrome forecast (TAF), aviation area forecast (FA), in-flight weather advisories (SIGMET, AIRMET) and the winds and temperatures aloft forecast (FD).

## Terminal Aerodrome Forecasts (TAF)

![TAF report example](https://studentpilotportal.com/photos/learn/taf_khou_ex.png)

One of the best forecasts products to determine future weather at a specific airport is the TAF. TAFs are valid for a 24-hour period and are scheduled four times a day at 0000Z, 0600Z, 1200Z, 1800Z. Each TAF contains station identifier, type, location, issuance date and time, valid date and time, and the forecast. Below shows how to decode a TAF:

1. **Type of report, ICAO, date and time of origin, and forecast conditions:** The initial part of a TAF is reported in the same format as an METAR. The first two numbers represent the day of the month, and the next four digits are the Zulu time that the forecast was issued. KHOU was issued the 24th day of the month at 1555Z. It's valid period 24 hours. The first two digits represent the valid date. Next is the beginning hour of the valid time in Zulu, and the last two digits are the ending hour. Visibility in a TAF is preceded by a "P" to indicate greater than or plus. Winds are 090º at 6 knots, visibility is expected to be greater than 6 statute miles, and broken at 3,000 feet AGL.
2. **Forecast change groups:** FM (from) BECMG (becoming) TEMPO (temporary) PROB (probability) From 1900Z winds 080º at 10 knots plus 6 statute miles, scattered at 1,200 feet and broken at 2,000 feet. From 2200Z wind 040º at 15 knots. Becoming 0600Z and 1000Z during this time period visibility should be plus 6 statute miles and wind 090º at 7 knots. Temporary 1900 between 2300 wind variable 8 knots gusting 18 knots 3 statute miles and light rain.



## Area Forecasts

![Area Forecasts example](https://studentpilotportal.com/photos/learn/weather_fa.png)

Area Forecasts covers general weather conditions and visual meteorological conditions over a wide region and is a good source of information for enroute weather. FA's are issued three times a day in the 48 contiguous states. Below shows an area forecast region map.



## Inflight Weather Advisories

![Airplane flying in sky](https://studentpilotportal.com/photos/learn/airplane_inflight.jpg)

Inflight weather advisories also provide enroute aircraft with forecasts of potentially hazardous weather. These advisories are also available prior to departure during flight training. An inflight weather advisory is issued in the form of an AIRMET, SIGMET, or convective SIGMET.

_AIRMET (WAs)_

AIRMENTs or Airmen Meteorological Information are issued every six hours with amendments issued as necessary for weather phenomena that are of operational interest to all aircraft; is reports moderate icing, moderate turbulence, sustained winds of 30 knots or more at the surface, ceiling less than 1,000 feet and/ or visibility less than 3 miles affecting over 50 percent of an area and extensive mountain obscuration. AIRMETs use the identifier Sierra for IFR conditions and mountain obscuration, Tango for turbulence, strong surface winds, and low-level wind shear, and Zulu for icing and freezing levels.

_SIGMET (WSs)_

SIGMETs are issued for hazardous weather (other than convective activity) that is considered significant to all aircraft. SIGMET criteria include severe icing, severe or extreme turbulence, clear air turbulence, dust storm and sandstorm lowering visibility to less than three miles and volcanic ash. Valid for four hours but if associated with a hurricane then valid for six hours.

_Convective SIGMET (WST)_

Convective SIGMETs, Convective Significant Meteorological Information, are issued for hazardous convective weather that is significant to the safety of all aircraft. include tornados, lines of thunderstorms, thunderstorms over a wide area, embedded thunderstorms, hail greater than 3/4 of an inch and wind gust to 50 knots or greater.



## Winds and Temperature Aloft Forecasts (FD)

![Winds and Temperature Aloft Forecasts Example](https://studentpilotportal.com/photos/learn/winds_temps_aloft.png)

FD provide the wind and temperature forecasts for specific locations in the US. The forecasts are made twice a day based on the radiosonde upper air observations taken at 0000Z and 1200Z. Through 12,000 feet are true altitudes and above 18,000 feet are pressure altitudes. Wind direction is always in reference to true north and wind speed is given in knots. No winds are forecasts when a given level is within 1,500 feet of the station elevation, and temperatures are not forecast for any station within 2,500 feet of the station elevation. If the wind speed is forecast greater than 100 knots but less than 199 knots, the computer adds 50 to the direction and subtracts 100 from the speed. For example, 731960 would indicate that the wind is 230º at 119 knots, and -60 C. If the wind is greater than 200 knots, it will appear as 73. And if calm, 9900, which means light and variable.



### Tips

- It is recommended that pilots combine each type of forecasts to get a complete overview of the weather for a particular area.
