# Air Masses and Fronts

---

Air masses and fronts influence weather systems across the world. As an air mass moves across bodies and water and land, it eventually comes in contact with another air mass with different characteristics. The boundary between two air masses is known as a front. An approaching front of any type always means changes to weather are imminent.

# Classification of Air Masses

![Air Mass Regions & Classification](https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/media.studentpilotportal.com/images/lesson-graphics/0013-5485552402.png)

An air mass is a body of air with uniform characteristics. Air masses are classified according to the regions where they originate - taking on the characteristics of the surrounding area or source region. A source region is typically an area in which the air remains relatively stagnant for a period of days or longer. During this time of stagnation, the air mass takes on the temperature and moisture characteristics of the source region. Areas of stagnation can be found in polar regions, tropical oceans, and dry deserts. 

Air masses are generally identified as polar or tropical based on temperature characteristics and maritime or continental based on moisture content. A continental polar air mass forms over a polar region and brings cool, dry air with it. Maritime tropical air masses form over warm tropical waters like the Caribbean Sea and bring warm, moist air. As the air mass moves from its source region and passes over land or water, the air mass is subjected to the varying conditions of the land or water which modify the nature of the air mass.

An air mass passing over a warmer surface is warmed from below, and convective currents form, causing the air to rise. This creates an unstable air mass with good surface visibility. Moist, unstable air causes cumulus clouds, showers, and turbulence to form.

Conversely, an air mass passing over a colder surface does not form convective currents but instead creates a stable air mass with poor surface visibility. The poor surface visibility is due to the fact that smoke, dust, and other particles cannot rise out of the air mass and are instead trapped near the surface. A stable air mass can produce low stratus clouds and fog.


_Air Mass Classification_

Abbreviation | Air Mass | Properties
------------ | ------------- | -------------
cA | Continental Artic | Cold, dry
cP | Continental Polar | Cold, dry
cT | Continental Tropical | Hot, dry
mA | Maritime Arctic | Cold, moist
mP | Maritime Polar | Cool, moist
mT | Maritime Tropical | Warm, moist



# What are Fronts?

![Frontal Activity](https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/media.studentpilotportal.com/images/lesson-graphics/0013-4552601974.png)

As an air mass moves across bodies of water and land, it eventually comes in contact with another air mass that has different characteristics. **The boundary layer between two types of air masses is known as a front.** An approaching front of any type always means changes to the weather are imminent. There are four types of fronts that are named according to the temperature of the advancing air relative to the temperature of the air it is replacing:  

1. Warm
2. Cold
3. Stationary
4. Occluded



## Warm Front

![Warm Front Example](https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/media.studentpilotportal.com/images/lesson-graphics/0013-0008670452.png)

A warm front occurs when a warm mass of air advances and replaces a body of colder air. Warm fronts move slowly, typically 10 to 25 miles per hour (mph). Since cold air is more dense, it remains in contact with the ground while the slope of the warm air slides over the top of the cooler air and gradually pushes it out of the area. Warm fronts contain warm air that often has very high humidity. As the warm air is lifted, the temperature drops and condensation occurs, usually forming cirriform clouds.


_Likely Associated Weather_

- Cirriform or stratiform clouds, along with fog along the frontal boundary prior to passage
- Cumulonimbus clouds (thunderstorms) likely to develop in summer months
- Light to moderate precipitation (rain, sleet, snow, drizzle)
- South-southeasterly winds
- Smooth air (little to no air turbulence)
- Poor visibility
- Falling barometric pressure until front passes completely
- Rising temperature due to warmer air
- Stratocumulus clouds, hazy conditions, and rain showers possible after front passage



## Cold Front

![Cold Front Example](https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/media.studentpilotportal.com/images/lesson-graphics/0013-8977586890.png)

A cold front occurs when a mass of cold, dense, and stable air advances and replaces a body of warmer air. Cold fronts move more rapidly than warm fronts, progressing at a rate of 25 to 30 mph. However, extreme cold fronts have been recorded moving at speeds of up to 60 mph. A typical cold front moves in a manner opposite that of a warm front. It is so dense, it stays close to the ground and acts like a snowplow, sliding under the warmer air and forcing the less dense air aloft. The rapidly ascending air causes the temperature to decrease suddenly, forcing the creation of clouds. The type of clouds that form depends on the stability of the warmer air mass. A cold front in the Northern Hemisphere is normally oriented in a northeast to southwest manner and can be several hundred miles long, encompassing a large area of land.

Fast-moving cold fronts are pushed by intense pressure systems far behind the actual front. The friction between the ground and the cold front retards the movement of the front and creates a steeper frontal surface. This results in a very narrow band of weather, concentrated along the leading edge of the front. If the warm air being overtaken by the cold front is relatively stable, overcast skies and rain may occur for some distance behind the front. If the warm air is unstable, scattered thunderstorms and rain showers may form. A continuous line of thunderstorms, or squall line, may form along or ahead of the front. Squall lines present a serious hazard to pilots as squall-type thunderstorms are intense and move quickly. Behind a fast-moving cold front, the skies usually clear rapidly, and the front leaves behind gusty, turbulent winds and colder temperatures. 


_Likely Associated Weather_

- Cirriform, towering cumulus, or cumulonimbus clouds with rain shows may develop prior to passage
- Towering cumulus or cumulonimbus clouds (which may include heavy rain showers accompanied by lighting, thunder, and/or hail) as front passes
- West-northwesternly winds
- Rougher/rising air (greater turbulence)
- Good visibility
- Falling barometeric pressure followed by gradual increase
- Rapidly falling temperatures
- Dissipation of cumulus clouds and decrease in precipitation after front passage



# Stationary Front

![Stationary Front Example](https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/media.studentpilotportal.com/images/lesson-graphics/0013-4566502348.png)

When the forces of two air masses are relatively equal, the boundary or front that separates them remains stationary or has very little movement and influences the local weather for days. This front is called a stationary front. The weather associated with a stationary front is typically a mixture that can be found in both warm and cold fronts.



# Occluded Front

![Occluded Front Example](https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/media.studentpilotportal.com/images/lesson-graphics/0013-5535412502.png)

An occluded front occurs when a fast-moving cold front catches up with a slow-moving warm front. As the occluded front approaches, warm front weather prevails but is immediately followed by cold front weather. **There are two types of occluded fronts that can occur: a cold front occlusion, and a warm front occlusion.** The temperatures of the colliding frontal systems play a large part in defining the type of front and the resulting weather.

A cold front occlusion occurs when a fast moving cold front is colder than the air ahead of the slow moving warm front. When this occurs, the cold air replaces the cool air and forces the warm front aloft into the atmosphere. Typically, the cold front occlusion creates a mixture of weather found in both warm and cold fronts, providing the air is relatively stable.

A warm front occlusion occurs when the air ahead of the warm front is colder than the air of the cold front. When this is the case, the cold front rides up and over the warm front. If the air forced aloft by the warm front occlusion is unstable, the weather is more severe than the weather found in a cold front occlusion. Embedded thunderstorms, rain, and fog are likely to occur.



# Chart Symbols for Fronts

![Front Chart Symbols](https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/media.studentpilotportal.com/images/lesson-graphics/0013-1565210589.png)

Chart symbols for surface fronts and other significant lines are shown on surface analysis charts. Individuals can use these symbols to help identify the type of front and it's relative movement. It is important to note that some sources may depict front symbols as black and white. Also, fronts shown in color code do not necessarily show frontal symbols. Therefore, having knowledge of each front symbol is key to understanding weather conditions and potential risks associated.



## Wind Shifts

![High & Low Press Wind Shift Examples](https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/media.studentpilotportal.com/images/lesson-graphics/0013-1522451858.png)

Wind around a high-pressure system rotates clockwise, while low-pressure winds rotate counter-clockwise. When two high pressure systems are adjacent, the winds are almost in direct opposition to each other at the point of contact. Fronts are the boundaries between two areas of high pressure, and therefore, wind shifts are continually occurring within a front. Shifting wind direction is most pronounced in conjunction with cold fronts.



### Tips

- No two fronts are the same, but general weather conditions are associated with each type and can be used to help identify the fronts.
- Squall lines present a serious hazard to pilots as squall-type thunderstorms are intense and move quickly. Trying to fly over the top or around storms are not optional or safe.
- Thunderstorms can extend up to well over the capability of small airplanes and can extend in a line for 300-500 miles.
- Wind shifts are most pronounced in association with cold fronts.
