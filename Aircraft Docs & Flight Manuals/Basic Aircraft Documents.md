# Basic Aircraft Documents

---

Operating an aircraft within the national airspace system requires a pilot to have certain documents onboard an aircraft at all times; this ensures the aircraft is airworthy and safe to fly.

## Airworthiness Certificate

![](https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/media.studentpilotportal.com/images/lesson-graphics/000-.png)

As the pilot in command (PIC) of an aircraft, you are ultimately responsible for the safe operation and outcome of a given flight. This starts with insuring that the aircraft that will be used for the flight has a valid and current airworthiness certificate. **The airworthiness of an aircraft is the responsibility of the pilot in command and is monitored by airworthiness inspectors. The certificate must be placed on the aircraft where the pilot or operator can easily see it.** Airworthiness certificates are issued under one of four types:
1. Standard Certificate
  - Normal Category
  - Utility Category
  - Acrobatic Category
  - Transport Category
2. Restricted Certificate
3. Limited Certificate
4. Experimental Certificate

Airworthiness certificates do not expire and are valid as long as the aircraft continue to meet the standards of the certificate it was issued under or it risks losing the certificate. The N-number on the certificate must match the N-number on the fuselage of the aircraft to be valid. If an aircraft has a restricted, limited, or experimental certificate it must be accompanied by a list of limitations and conditions that are necessary for safe operation.

The aircraft owner is responsible for obtaining an airworthiness certificate by completing [FAA Form 8130-6, Application for U.S. Airworthiness Certificate](https://www.faa.gov/forms/index.cfm/go/document.information/documentID/1019145).



## Registration Certificate

![](https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/media.studentpilotportal.com/images/lesson-graphics/000-.png)

The FAA Civil Aviation Registry Aircraft Registration Branch (AFS-750) maintains registration records on individual aircraft and serves as a repository for airworthiness documents received from FAA field offices.

**An aircraft registration certificate is valid for three years and expires three years after the last day of the month in which it is issued. If the registered owner has changed a temporary registration (Pink Slip) is issued, which is good for 120 days.** If the ownership has changed without a Pink Slip or the N- numbers do not match, the registration is not valid.

According to §47.41 Duration and return of Certificate, a Certificate of Aircraft Registration may also be ended if one of the following occurs:
- The aircraft is totally destroyed or scrapped.
- The holder of the certificate loses his U.S. citizenship.
- 30 days have elapsed since the death of the holder of the certificate.
- The owner, if an individual who is not a citizen of the United States, loses status as a resident alien, unless that person becomes a citizen of the United States at the same time.
- The corporation (if the owner is a corporation) ceases to be lawfully organized and doing business under the laws of the United States or any State thereof
- The death of the holder of the certificate (an executor of his/her estate must re-register within 60 days)

The aircraft owner is responsible for registering and renewing an aircraft's registration certificates as well as notifying AFS-750 of any change of permanent mailing address, the sale or export of an aircraft, or the loss of owner's ability to register an aircraft in accordance with Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 47, section 47.41. Registration Certificates are obtained by completing [FAA Form 8050-1, Aircraft Registration Application](https://www.faa.gov/forms/index.cfm/go/document.information/documentID/185220), while Registration Renewals are done by completing [FAA Form 8050-1B, Aircraft Registration Renewal Application](https://www.faa.gov/forms/index.cfm/go/document.information/documentID/1024690).



## Radio Station License

![](https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/media.studentpilotportal.com/images/lesson-graphics/000-.png)

Although the FAA does not regulate it, a radio station license is required by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for all international operations. When operating internationally, both the pilot and aircraft must have valid radio station licenses. The license may be for that particular N-number or a fleet license. The expiration date of the license is in the upper right hand corner. Any discrep­ancy concerning the radio license should be brought to the attention of the operator only.

To obtain an FCC radio station license, pilots must complete an [FCC Form 605, Quick-Form Application for Authorization in the Ship, Aircraft, Amateur, Restricted and Commercial Operator, and General Mobile Radio Services](https://www.fcc.gov/wireless/support/fcc-form-605), available at [https://www.fcc.gov](https://www.fcc.gov).



## Operating Limitations

![](https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/media.studentpilotportal.com/images/lesson-graphics/000-.png)

Prior to operating a civil airplane, pilots must assure that the aircraft has an available current Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) or approved manual materials, if required. An Airplane Flight Manual is a document developed by the aircraft manufacturer approved for use by the FAA, is required to be on board the aircraft along with the any appropriate markings and placards. **This book contains the operating procedures and any limitations of a particular aircraft with special instructions required to operate an aircraft safely. The pilot must comply with this information which is specific to an aircraft's year, make, and model - usually linked by serial number.**

Some aircraft will have additional supplemental operating and performance information which has not been specifically or formally approved by the FAA. This information is generally in the form of an "Owner's Handbook," an "Owner's Manual," or as supplemental pages in an AFM. The FAA recommends recommend appropriate use of such unapproved information when furnished by a manufacturer, but only to the extent that limitations of any FAA-approved markings, placards, airplane flight manuals, or Type Certificate Data Sheet specification.

The primary source for identifying required Airplane Flight Manuals, Approved Manual Materials, Markings, and Placards is the FAA Type Certificate Data Sheet or Aircraft Specification issued for each airplane eligible for an airworthiness certification. This information may be obtained from FAA General Aviation District Offices (GADOs), Flight Standards District Offices (FSDOs), FAA-approved aircraft repair stations, and certificated mechanics holding Inspection Authorizations. Some other aircraft repair facilities also maintain a reference library of Type Certificate Data Sheets.

**Most light aircraft built after 1975 include a Pilot Operating Handbook (POH), which is also designated as the FAA-approved flight manual. The typical AFM/POH contains the following nine sections: General; Limitations; Emergency Procedures; Normal Procedures; Performance; Weight and Balance/Equipment List; Systems Description; Handling, Service, and Maintenance; and Supplements.**

If a pilots is ever uncertain about specific requirements for a give airplane, it is crucial that he/she consult with an the Airplane Flight Manual or other approved material for that aircraft before continuing its operation.



## Weight and Balance Information

![](https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/media.studentpilotportal.com/images/lesson-graphics/000-.png)

Weight and balance information provided by the aircraft manufacturer, maintenance and modification records, including a list of equipment, must be on board the aircraft. This is not be confused with a weight and balance data sheet a pilot completes before each flight to ensure the center of gravity is within limits. The weight and balance information is a list of all equipment in the aircraft such as radios, flight instruments, seats, etc. Some multiengine operators have Minimum Equipment Lists (MEL's) with a letter of authorization issued by a district office. These constitute a supplemental type certificate for the aircraft and must be on board. The FAA inspector will compare any inop­erative equipment to the MEL to assure compliance.



## Ramp Inspections

![](https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/media.studentpilotportal.com/images/lesson-graphics/000-.png)

During a pilot's time operating under Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) Part 91, he/she may have to undergo a ramp inspection by an FAA operations inspector. The purpose of this inspection is to determine that an airman or operator is in continuing compliance with the FAR during an actual operations at an airfield. Pilots are subject to ramp inspections at any time by an authorized FAA inspector and will usually not know of an inspector's presence until the inspector provide identification.

Most ramp inspections are not planned and may occur if an inspector observes an unsafe operation in the traffic pattern or ramp, is notified by air traffic control of unsafe operations, or an inspector is conducting normal surveillance. When a ramp inspection is planned for a specific operator, it is usually because of recurring complaints, suspected violations of the FAR, or part of a special emphasis program required by the regional office or headquarters.

The FAA inspector will require that the pilots or operators present their airman and medical certificates, and radio license (for international operations) along with the aircraft's documents. Many pilots find it helpful to remember the acronym _ARROW_ as a memory aid for remembering the required aircraft documents:
- **A** irworthiness Certificate
- **R** egistration Certificate
- **R** adio Station License (international flights only)
- **O** perating Limitations
- **W** eight and Balance Information

The outcome of ramp inspections are recorded by the district office as either satisfactory or an unsatisfactory. For unsatisfactory inspections, the FAA will either conduct a possible enforcement investigation or issue a letter of correction - this action may be followed by another inspection to determine if any noted discrepancies have been corrected.



### Tips

- All U.S. registered aircraft will have a registration/tail number beginning with the letter "N".
- The FAA does not regulate the requirement for a Radio Station License, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) requires this license for international flights.
- Most light aircraft built after 1975 include a Pilot Operating Handbook (POH), which is also designated as the FAA-approved flight manual.
