[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://studentpilotportal.com)

This effort is being lead by Student Pilot Portal, an online flight training platform that helps pilots learn about aviation and enable them to share their passion for flight with other like-minded pilots. **Our mission is to improve pilot proficiency worldwide.** We created this project to meet the rapidly growing educational needs and training requirements for student pilots.
