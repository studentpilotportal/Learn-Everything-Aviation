# Newton's Basic Laws of Motion

---

Sir Isaac Newton formulated the law of universal gravitation as well as the three basic laws of motion. His work solidified the foundation for basic physical laws that relate to an aircraft’s creation of lift. Having an understanding of these laws provide a pilot the basis for understanding how an aircraft moves in space.

## Newton’s First Law

> “Every object persists in its state of rest or uniform motion in a straight line unless it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed on it.”

_Explanation_

An object at rest, tends to stay at rest; while an object in motion, tends to stay in motion unless acted upon by an external force. This means that a parked aircraft will not move unless a force is applied to it. Once it is in motion, its inertia keeps it moving until another force is applied to it to change speed or direction. In this case, the force that would stop a taxiing aircraft is either brakes applied by the pilot or friction from the landing gear.



## Newton’s Second Law

> “Force is equal to the change in momentum per change in time. For a constant mass, force equals mass times acceleration.”

_Explanation_

When a body is acted upon by a constant force, its resulting acceleration is inversely proportional to the mass of the body and is directly proportional to the applied force. If two aircraft have to move from point A to point B, the force needed to move the heavier aircraft at the same speed of the lighter aircraft will have to be greater than the force used to move the lighter aircraft. The lighter aircraft requires less energy and will move faster than the heavier aircraft if the same force is applied to both.

```
  Force = mass x acceleration
  Force = rate of change of momentum
```



## Newton’s Third Law

> “For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.”

_Explanation_

This law is easily observed when a propeller of an aircraft moves and pushes back the air; consequently, the air pushes the propeller in the opposite direction, moving the aircraft forward since the propeller is attached to the aircraft. In jet aircraft, the engine pushes a blast of hot gases backward; the force of equal and opposite reaction pushes against the engine and forces the airplane forward.
