# The Role of the Instructor

---

Flight instructors play the most important role in a student pilot's flight training. They train pilots in all knowledge areas and teach the skills needed to operate an aircraft safely, efficiently, and responsibility.

[[Category: "Beginning Flight"]]



## Instructor Responsibilities

![](https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/media.studentpilotportal.com/images/lesson-graphics/000-.png)

Certified Flight Instructors (CFI) and Certified Ground Instructors (CGI) are solely responsible for training pilots and making sure they meet all proficiency requirements listed in the Airmen Certification Standards (ACS) for the applicable pilot certificate or rating that pilot is seeking; this includes, but not limited to, airmanship skills, airspace knowledge, regulation knowledge, performance or pilot limitations, pilot judgment and decision-making, and good operating practices.

The FAA has adopted an operational training concept that places the full
responsibility for student training on the flight instructor. In this role, the
flight instructor assumes total responsibility for training you to meet the
standards required for certification and the skills required to safely and efficiently function as a certificated pilot.

An instructor should possess an understanding of the learning process, a knowledge of the fundamentals of teaching, and the ability to communicate effectively with the student pilot.

Whether you attend a part 141 or part 61 school or obtain the services of an individual flight instructor, the specific knowledge and skill areas for each category and class of aircraft are outlined in Title Change 1 (February 2016) 2
14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR). Refer to 14 CFR part 61, subpart J for the requirements of a sport pilot certificate. Refer to 14 CFR part 61, subpart D for the requirements of a recreational pilot certificate. Refer to 14 CFR part 61, subpart E for the requirements of a private pilot certificate.



## Instructor and Student Relationship

![](https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/media.studentpilotportal.com/images/lesson-graphics/000-.png)

During your training, you may encounter various instructors. Whether or not you plan to fly professionally, your training experience and flying career will depend heavily on the quality of the ground and flight instruction you receive from your instructor. Each instructor will have their own teaching style. Regardless of that instructor's style of teaching, you should have complete confidence in your instructor. He or she has meet all the requirements to become a certificated instructor under 14 CFR part 61 and is capable of operating an aircraft safely.

The flight instructor will provide guidance and arrange your academic and flight training lessons. He or she will typically use a building block method, where each lesson your learn serves as the foundation for future growth. These lessons are presented in a logical manner to help you achieve your goals. After each flight, the flight instructor will conduct a debrief where key components of a flight or ground session are reviewed. This will be the time to clear up any questions. It is important that misconceptions be clarified while the subject is still fresh in mind.



## What the Instructor Expects of Each Student

![](https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/media.studentpilotportal.com/images/lesson-graphics/000-.png)

Your instructor understands the time, effort, and expense involved in flight training and wants to see you succeed. He or she will require you to demonstrate knowledge in all applicable areas and proficiency in flight in order to move forward to each lesson. It is never an instructor's intention to repeat a lesson unless the instructor feels that the student will not be successful or be able to maintain safety for an upcoming flight.

It is your responsibility to come prepared to each training session. You should use the training course outline given to you as a guide to what will be covered at each phase of your training and read any information relating to that lesson so that you can have a basic understanding of the material and come with any questions on the information that was not clear. It is often said that the airplane makes a terrible classroom. The best time to learn is before your flight lesson, so that you and your instructor makes the most effective use of your time flying in the airplane.

Like anything else in life, the more you educated yourself and are aware of
what is expected of you, the more control you have of your goal’s outcome.
