# Brief History of Flight

---

Since the beginning of time, man has always dreamed of flight. We've watched birds soar and try tirelessly to imitate the complex system we now know. Many lives were lost in pursuit of flight. But it is only now that modern technology allows us to fly, live, and be free just like the birds.

## Leonardo da Vinci (1500s)

Perhaps the most recognized of his time, Leonardo da Vinci, first gave us inspiration of flying machines. Although most of his ideas were flawed because he insisted on a machine that consisted of bird-like wings, each failure gave birth to need ideas and technology.



## Robert Hooke (1655s)

Mathematician, Physicist, and Inventor Robert Hooke's research confirms that the human body on its own is not capable of flight due to the great amount of energy required to fly. He sets a new direction in aviation with his believe of achieving flight with artificial propulsion.



## First Manned Balloon Flight (1783)

Joseph and Etienne Montgolfier takes flight in the first manned hot air balloon, which flew for a total of 23 minutes. Ten days later, Professor Jacques Charles flew the first gas balloon. This gave flying enthusiasts hope to the promise of lighter-than-air-flight. Balloons solved the major problem of generating lift; however, its major setback was its lack of speed and directional control.



## Father of Aerial Navigation

It wasn't until the 13th century that man would discover a way to lift a heavier-than-air machine into the air. Sir George Cayley spent his 84 years developing a machine that would fly based on a child's toy kite, used by the Chinese for aerial observation and to test winds for sailing. Cayley's work laid the foundation to the basic principles on which modern aeronautics is founded. And his work is recognized as the first successful flying model capable of carrying a person.



## The Kitty Hawk Flyer

After Sir George Cayley's death, many worked on achieving the first powered flying machine. William Samuel Henson, designed and tested a monoplane propelled by a steam engine housed inside the fuselage. Otto Lilienthal also worked to prove that human flight in heavier-than-air machines were practical.

Dreams would finally take of on December 17, 1903, when Wilbur and Orville Wright took flight in the first powered machine known as their Kitty Hawk Flyer. The brothers, who first worked as bicycle builders, experimented for 4 years with kites, their own homemade wind tunnel, and different engines to power their biplane. By the end of December 17th, the Wright Brothers total flight time after four flights were 98 seconds. This gave birth to general aviation as we know it today.
