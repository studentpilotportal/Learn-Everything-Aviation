# Runway Incursion Avoidance

---

Runway incursions create a collision hazard to aircraft intending to takeoff or land. Although procedures have been put in place to reduce runway incursions, pilots must exercise caution to maintain visual separation from all aircraft.

## What is a Runway Incursion?

![](https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/media.studentpilotportal.com/images/lesson-graphics/000-.png)

A runway incursion is any occurrence in the airport runway environment involving an aircraft, vehicle, person, or object on the ground that creates a collision hazard or results in a loss of required separation with an aircraft taking off, intending to takeoff, landing, or intending to land. Situational awareness is key to preventing runway incursions. Proper planning can prevent runway incursion and the possibility of a ground collision. A pilot should be aware of the positions of other aircraft operating within the airport environment and should also announce intentions of the radio. At times, towered airports can be busy and taxi instructions complex - it may be advisable to write down taxi instructions.

Runway incursions are divided into four categories:
  1. Category A: a serious incident in which a collision was narrowly avoided.
  2. Category B: an incident in which separation decrees and there is a significant potential for collision, which may result in a time critical corrective/evasive response to avoid collision.
  3. Category C: an incident characterized by ample time and/or distance to avoid a collision.
  4. Category D: an incident that meets the definition of runway incursion such as incorrect presence of single vehicle/person/aircraft on the protected area of a surface designated for landing and take-off of aircraft but with no immediate safety consequences.



## Examples of Runway Incursions

![](https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/media.studentpilotportal.com/images/lesson-graphics/000-.png)

According to FAA data, approximately 65% of all runway incursions are caused by pilots. Of the pilot runway incursions, data suggests almost half of those incursions are caused by general aviation pilots. There are three types of runway incursions: (1) pilot deviations, (2) operational incidents, and (3) vehicle deviations.

**Pilot Deviations**

A pilot deviation (PD) is an action of a pilot that violates any Federal Aviation Regulation. While PDs should be avoided, the regulations do authorize deviation from a clearance in response to a traffic alert and collision avoidance system resolution advisory. You must notify ATC as soon as possible following a deviation.

_Examples of pilot deviations_

  - Crossing a runway hold marking without clearance from ATC
  - Taking off without clearance
  - Landing without clearance


**Operational Incidents (OI)**

Operational incidents are actions of an Air Traffic Controller that results in less than required minimum separation between two or more aircraft, or between an aircraft and obstacles, (vehicles, equipment, personnel on runways) or clearing an aircraft o take off or land on a closed runway.

_Examples of operation incidents_

  - Clearing an aircraft onto a runway while another aircraft is landing on the same runway
  - Issuing a takeoff clearance while the runway is occupied by another aircraft or vehicle


**Vehicle (Driver) Deviations**

Vehicle deviations are pedestrians or vehicles entering any portion of the airport movement areas (runways or taxiways) without authorization from air traffic control.

_Examples of vehicle deviations_

  - Crossing a runway hold marking without ATC clearance



## Contributing Factors of Runway Incursions

![](https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/media.studentpilotportal.com/images/lesson-graphics/000-.png)

About three runways incursions occur each day at towered airports within the United States. Although there are many elements that lead to runway incursions, three major areas were found after detailed investigations.
  - Failure to comply with ATC instructions
  - Lack of airport familiarity
  - Nonconformance with standard operating procedures

Clear, concise, and effective pilot/controller communication is paramount to safe airport surface operations. You must fully understand and comply with all ATC instructions. It is mandatory to read back all runway “hold short” instructions verbatim. Taxiing on an unfamiliar airport can be very challenging, especially during hours of darkness or low visibility. A request may be made for progressive taxi instructions which include step by step taxi routing instructions. Ensure you have a current airport diagram, remain “heads-up” with eyes outside, and devote your entire attention to surface navigation per ATC clearance. All checklists should be completed while the aircraft is stopped.



## Avoiding Runway Confusion

![](https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/media.studentpilotportal.com/images/lesson-graphics/000-.png)

Runway confusion is another factor that leads to runway incursions and
often results in a pilot unintentionally taking off or landing on
a taxiway or wrong runway. There are three major factors that increase the risk of runway confusion and can lead to a wrong runway departure: (1) Airport complexity, (2) Close proximity of runway thresholds, and (3) Joint use of a runway as a taxiway.

The more complex an airport is, the higher the chance of a runway confusion. If you are operating at an unfamiliar airport and need assistance in executing the taxi clearance, do not hesitate to ask ATC for help. Always carry a current airport diagram and trace or highlight your taxi route to the departure runway
prior to leaving the ramp. When operating from an airport with runway thresholds in close proximity to one another, exercise extreme caution when taxiing onto the runway.

A good practice is to set the aircraft's heading "bug" to the runway that you intend to take off or land on and confirm that the aircraft is aligned with the runway heading to avoid departing or landing on the wrong runway. Under certain circumstances, it may be necessary to use a runway as a taxiway. For example, during airport construction some taxiways may be closed requiring rerouting of traffic onto runways. In other cases, departing traffic may be required to back taxi on the runway in order to utilize the full runway length.

Another way to mitigate the risk of runway incursions is to write down all taxi instructions as soon as they are received from ATC. It is also helpful to monitor ATC
clearances and instructions that are issued to other aircraft. You should be especially vigilant if another aircraft has a similar sounding call sign so there is no mistake about who ATC is contacting or to whom they are giving instructions
and clearances. Read back your complete ATC clearance with your aircraft
call sign. This gives ATC the opportunity to clarify any misunderstandings and ensure that instructions were given to the correct aircraft. If, at any time, there is uncertainty about any ATC instructions or clearances, ask ATC to “say again”
or ask for progressive taxi instructions.



### Tips

- Never assume clearance or any other instructions given by ATC. Always clarify and write complex instructions when necessary.
- Read back all taxi and runway crossing and/or hold instructions.
- Review airport layouts as part of preflight planning before descending to land and while taxiing, as needed.
- Be familiar with all airport signs and markings.
- Review NOTAM for information on runway/taxiway closures and constructions areas.
- Request progressive taxi instructions from ATC when unsure of the taxi route.
- Check for traffic before crossing any runway hold line and before entering a taxiway.
- Turn on aircraft lights and the rotating beacon or strobe lights while taxiing.
- When landing, clear the active runway as soon as possible, then wait for taxi instructions before further movement.
- Study and use proper phraseology in order to understand and respond to ground control instructions.
- Write down complex taxi instructions at unfamiliar airports.
