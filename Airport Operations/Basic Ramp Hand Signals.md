# Basic Ramp Hand Signals

---

Ramp hand signals provide pilots and line personnel a method of communicating effectively when voice communications are not readily available or are impractical. It is common for pilots to encounter line personnel upon arrival to an airport for parking or while taxiing away from a congested parking area. The line crew usually consists of a signalman (the person who directs the aircraft) and sometimes two other persons that are tasked with ensuring the aircraft's wings are clear of any obstacles.

## All Clear

The all clear signal tells the pilot that the aircraft is cleared of any obstructions, ground service equipment, and ramp personnel. It usually signals the beginning of a departure sequence, but does not necessarily mean that the pilot may start engines or move the aircraft.



## Start Engine

The start engine signal tells the pilot that he/she may now start the engine that the signalman is pointing to. For aircraft with more than two engines, the signalman may indicate the engine to be started by showing a corresponding finger count pointing to the side the engine is on. For example, the signalman may hold up four fingers while pointing to the left side of the aircraft when viewing the aircraft from the front. For single engine aircraft, indicating an engine may be completely omitted since it is clear which engine will be starting.

Sometimes the pilot may wish to communicate which engine needs to be started first, this can be done using the same hand gestures.



## Pull Chocks

The pull chocks signal communicates that the chocks (which are wedges made usually from rubber that prevents an aircraft from movement while parked) has been removed. Although the aircraft can move freely now, it does not necessarily clear the pilot to do so.



## Proceed Straight Ahead

The proceed straight ahead signal communicates that the aircraft is cleared of any obstructions such as ground service equipment or ramp personnel and may move forward from its current position, taxiing the aircraft directly to the signalman.



## Left Turn

The left turn signal tells the pilot that he/she needs to turn the nose of the aircraft to the left of it current ground track. When this signal is given, it means that the pilot should continue to turn the aircraft left until another signal follows such as the proceed straight ahead.



## Right Turn

The right turn signal tells the pilot that he/she needs to turn the nose of the aircraft to the right of it current ground track. When this signal is given, it means that the pilot should continue to turn the aircraft right until another signal follows such as the proceed straight ahead.



## Slow Down

The slow down signal tells the pilot that he/she is taxiing at an unsafe rate of speed and needs to slow the aircraft down in order to regain a safe environment for everyone.



## Flagman Directs Pilot

The flagman directs pilot signal communicates that a parking area is available and to proceed directly to the person giving the signal. Sometimes multiple personnel will be used to guide the aircraft into specified area.



## Stop

The stop signals tells the pilot when the aircraft needs to be stopped. The signalman will usually raise their hands slowly to indicate a smooth controlled stop. The signalman will use this slow smooth movement to time where the aircraft needs to stop in order properly chock, tie-down, or position a jet bridge.



## Emergency Stop

The emergency stop signal is similar to the stop signal, but the movement of the signalman's hands will be brisk, indicating that the aircraft needs to be stop immediately to prevent any incidents from occurring.



## Insert Chocks

The insert chocks signal communicates that the chocks (which are wedges made usually from rubber that prevents an aircraft from movement while parked) has been inserted. Before line personnel approach the aircraft to insert the chocks, it is expected that the pilot will apply the parking brakes to prevent inadvertent movement of the aircraft. If the parking brakes is inoperative, the pilot must manually apply brakes until he receives the insert chocks signal.


## Cut Engines

The cut engines signal communicates that it is now safe to begin the aircraft shutdown procedures to secure the aircraft for parking. It is up to the pilot to determine the proper shutdown sequence according to their pilot's operating handbook or approved flight manual.



## Night Operations

During night or times of low visibility such as haze, fog, dust, or other weather phenomenon that may reduce visibility, line personnel will use lighted wands to direct an aircraft to and from parking. The hand movements are the same as during day operation and should be followed in that manner.



### Tips

- If you are unfamiliar with an airport or feel disoriented while taxiing, stop the aircraft and try to regain situational awareness. If still lost ask ATC for progressive taxi instructions.
- Never taxi at a speed that the aircraft would not be able to stop within a few feet if the brakes failed and power reduced to idle.
- Never try to complete a checklist while taxing, unless part of a multi-crew as this increases the risk a safety hazard from not being focused while reading a checklist. It also increases the likelihood that an important item may be missed.
- If a signalman is present, follow all instructions he/she is giving you. If you require special instructions or have certain parking preferences, contact the FBO before arrival to make arrangements.



### Federal Aviation Regulations

- <span class="badge-warning font-w700 px-1">&#167; 91.123(a)</span> Compliance with ATC clearances and instructions. ...When a pilot is uncertain of an ATC clearance, that pilot shall immediately request clarification from ATC.
