# ATC Light Signals

---

The use of air traffic control (ATC) light signals helps give directions to aircraft, ground vehicles, equipment, and personnel not equipped with a radio. If radio contact cannot be established for any reason, ATC light signals will also be utilized in order to provide guidance.

## Controlling of Aircraft

![](https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/media.studentpilotportal.com/images/lesson-graphics/0003-1221354760.png)

Pilots utilize air traffic control for various types of information, such as weather and traffic alerts (workload permitting). The controlling of aircraft effectively enhances the operations at airports - especially during takeoffs and landings. If radio contact cannot be established between ATC and a particular aircraft, the added layer of safety is lost.

**If you find yourself in a situation where the aircraft's radio becomes inoperative or the aircraft you're flying is not equipped with radio, you must follow instructions received from ATC by use of light signals when operating at controlled airports.** All pilots are required to be familiar with ATC light signals.

**Note:** It is nearly impossible to predict every type of radio failure scenario, therefore, pilots are expected to exercise good judgement in whatever action they elect to take.

_ATC Light Signals: Aircraft_

Color and Type of Signal | Aircraft on the Ground | Aircraft in Flight
------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
Steady green | Cleared for takeoff | Cleared to land
Flashing green | Cleared for taxi | Return for landing (to be followed by steady green at the proper time)
Steady red | STOP | Give way to other aircraft and continue circling
Flashing red | Taxi clear of the runway in use | Airport unsafe, do not land
Flashing white | Return to starting point on airport | Not applicable
Alternating red and green | Exercise extreme caution | Exercise extreme caution



## Controlling Ground Vehicles, Equipment, and Personnel

On airports/heliports where there is an active tower, all ground vehicles, equipment, and personnel must obtain prior approval from ATC for entry onto all movement areas. In the U.S., the term "movement area" means the runways, taxiways, and other areas of an airport/heliport which are utilized for taxiing, hover taxiing, air-taxiing, take-off and landing of aircraft, not including loading ramps and parking areas.

_ATC Light Signals: Ground Vehicles, Equipment, and Personnel_

Color and Type of Signal | Movement of Vehicles, Equipment, and Personnel
------------- | -------------
Steady green | Cleared to cross, proceed or go
Flashing green | Not applicable
Steady red | STOP
Flashing red | Clear the taxiway/runway
Flashing white | Return to starting point on airport
Alternating red and green | Exercise extreme caution



## Disadvantages of ATC Light Signals

![](https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/media.studentpilotportal.com/images/lesson-graphics/0003-6908978871.png)

When ATC uses the traffic control signal to control traffic, it emits an intense narrow beam of light (either red, white, or green). Although the traffic signal offers the advantage that some control may be exercised over nonradio-equipped aircraft, pilots should be aware of the disadvantages, such as:
- The pilot may not be looking at the control tower at the time a signal is directed toward the aircraft.
- The directions transmitted by a light signal are _very limited since only approval of a pilot's anticipated actions may be transmitted._ No supplement or explanatory information may be transmitted except by the use of the "General Warning Signal," which advises the pilots to be on the alert.
- Between sunset and sunrise, a pilot wishing to attract the attention of the control tower should turn on a landing light and taxi the aircraft into a position, clear of the active runway, so that light is visible to the tower. The landing light should remain on until appropriate signals are received from the tower.



### Tips

- Familiarize yourself with all ATC light signals before you need them. Some kneeboards have this information printed on it for easy reference.
- Sometimes pilots may interpret a wrong frequency as a radio failure after accidently changing a frequency while manipulating another radio or navigation control. Be sure you have the correct radio frequency.
- It is nearly impossible to predict every type radio failure scenario, therefore, pilots are expected to exercise good judgement in whatever action they elect to take.
- Having ATC guidance during takeoffs, landings, and en route does not negate the pilots responsibility for seeing and avoiding other aircraft.
- If radio communication is lost, it may be a good decision to land at a non-towered airport with lower traffic volume, if practical. When operating at a non-towered airport, no radio communication is necessary.



### Federal Aviation Regulations

- <span class="badge-warning font-w700 px-1">&#167; 91.113(b)</span> Right-of-way rules: Except water operations. ...Regardless of whether an operation is conducted under instrument flight rules or visual flight rules, vigilance shall be maintained by each person operating an aircraft so as to see and avoid other aircraft...
- <span class="badge-warning font-w700 px-1">&#167; 91.123(a)</span> Compliance with ATC clearances and instructions. When an ATC clearance has been obtained, no pilot in command may deviate from that clearance unless an amended clearance is obtained, an emergency exists, or the deviation is in response to a traffic alert and collision avoidance system resolution advisory... When a pilot is uncertain of an ATC clearance, that pilot shall immediately request clarification from ATC.
