# Airport Traffic Patterns

---

Traffic patterns are established to ensure safe operation of arriving and departing aircraft within the vicinity of the airport. Each airport's pattern is unique to its operation and is developed based on the local conditions, altitude required to clear obstacles, and published instrument procedures.

## Legs of the Traffic Pattern

A traffic pattern is a rectangular course flown while departing and arriving at an airport. It is used to organize the flow of air traffic in the vicinity of an airport, which helps increase safety and reduce airport congestion. A traffic pattern consists of five (5) legs:
1. **Upwind leg.** - The flight path parallel to the landing runway in the direction of landing.
2. **Crosswind leg.** - The flight path at a right angle to departure end of the landing runway.
3. **Downwind leg.** - The flight path parallel to the landing runway in the opposite direction of landing.
4. **Base leg.** - The flight path path at a right angle to the approach end of the landing runway.
5. **Final approach.** - The flight path that extends from the runway centerline at the approach end of the landing runway.

All turns in the traffic pattern should be made to the left (known as "Standard Traffic") unless right turns (known as "Non-standard Traffic")
