## Aeronautical Knowledge and Experience

A person who is applying for a private pilot certificate must receive and log ground training from an authorized instructor or complete a home-study course on the following aeronautical knowledge areas that apply to the aircraft category and class rating sought:
  - Accident reporting requirements of the National Transportation Safety Board
  - Use of the applicable portions of the “Aeronautical Information Manual” and FAA advisory circulars
  - Use of aeronautical charts for VFR navigation using pilotage, dead reckoning, and navigation systems
  - Radio communication procedures
  - Recognition of critical weather situations from the ground and in flight, windshear avoidance, and the procurement and use of aeronautical weather reports and forecasts
  - Safe and efficient operation of aircraft, including collision avoidance, and recognition and avoidance of wake turbulence
  - Effects of density altitude on takeoff and climb performance
  - Weight and balance computations
  - Principles of aerodynamics, powerplants, and aircraft systems
  - Stall awareness, spin entry, spins, and spin recovery techniques for the airplane and glider category ratings

    - How to obtain information on runway lengths at airports of intended use, data on takeoff and landing distances, weather reports and forecasts, and fuel requirements
    - How to plan for alternatives if the planned flight cannot be completed or delays are encountered

While there are many ratings a pilot can apply for as a private pilot, we will have listed the required aeronautical experience for the most common rating, the airplane single-engine rating:
  - At least 40 hours of total flight time which includes:
    - 20 hours of flight training from an authorized instructor
    - 3 hours of cross-country flight training in a single-engine airplane
    - 3 hours of night flight training in a single-engine airplane that includes:

      - 10 takeoffs and 10 landings to a full stop (with each landing involving a flight in the traffic pattern) at an airport
    - 3 hours of flight training in a single-engine airplane on the control and maneuvering of an airplane solely by reference to instruments, including straight and level flight, constant airspeed climbs and descents, turns to a heading, recovery from unusual flight attitudes, radio communications, and the use of navigation systems/facilities and radar services appropriate to instrument flight
    - 3 hours of flight training with an authorized instructor in a single-engine airplane in preparation for the practical test, which must have been performed within the preceding 2 calendar months from the month of the test
    - 10 hours of solo flight time in a single-engine airplane, consisting of at least:
      - 5 hours of solo cross-country time
      - One solo cross country flight of 150 nautical miles total distance, with full-stop landings at three points, and one segment of the flight consisting of a straight-line distance of more than 50 nautical miles between the takeoff and landing locations
      - Three takeoffs and three landings to a full stop (with each landing involving a flight in the traffic pattern) at an airport with an operating control tower.

_Aeronautical experience requirements relating to other ratings can be found in §61.109_

## Privileges and Limitations

![](https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/media.studentpilotportal.com/images/lesson-graphics/000-.png)

Generally, a person who holds a private pilot certificate may not act as pilot in command of an aircraft that is carrying passengers or property for compensation or hire; nor may that person, for compensation or hire, act as pilot in command of an aircraft. For aircraft requiring more than one pilot, the pilot may also not act as second in command of that aircraft for compensation or hire, or if that aircraft is carrying passengers or property for compensation or hire. However, the regulations do allow certain exceptions to this rule.

_Exceptions_

  1. A private pilot may, for compensation or hire, act as pilot in command of an aircraft in connection with any business or employment if:
    - The flight is only incidental to that business or employment; and
    - The aircraft does not carry passengers or property for compensation or hire.
  2. A private pilot may not pay less than the pro rata share of the operating expenses of a flight with passengers, provided the expenses involve only fuel, oil, airport expenditures, or rental fees.
  3. A private pilot may act as pilot in command of a charitable, nonprofit, or community event flight described in §91.146, if the sponsor and pilot comply with the requirements of §91.146.
  4. A private pilot may be reimbursed for aircraft operating expenses that are directly related to search and location operations, provided the expenses involve only fuel, oil, airport expenditures, or rental fees, and the operation is sanctioned and under the direction and control of:
    - A local, State, or Federal agency; or
    - An organization that conducts search and location operations.
  5. A private pilot who is an aircraft salesman and who has at least 200 hours of logged flight time may demonstrate an aircraft in flight to a prospective buyer.
  6. A private pilot who meets the requirements of §61.69 may act as a pilot in command of an aircraft towing a glider or unpowered ultralight vehicle.
  7. A private pilot may act as pilot in command for the purpose of conducting a production flight test in a light-sport aircraft intended for certification in the light-sport category under §21.190 of this chapter, provided that—
    - The aircraft is a powered parachute or a weight-shift-control aircraft;
    - The person has at least 100 hours of pilot-in-command time in the category and class of aircraft flown; and
    - The person is familiar with the processes and procedures applicable to the conduct of production flight testing, to include operations conducted under a special flight permit and any associated operating limitations.
  8. A private pilot may act as pilot in command of an aircraft without holding a medical certificate issued under FAR Part 67 provided the pilot holds a valid U.S. driver's license, meets the requirements of §61.23(c)(3), and complies with this section and all of the following conditions and limitations:
    - The aircraft is authorized to carry not more than 6 occupants, has a maximum takeoff weight of not more than 6,000 pounds, and is operated with no more than five passengers on board; and
    - The flight, including each portion of the flight, is not carried out—
      - At an altitude that is more than 18,000 feet above mean sea level;
      - Outside the United States unless authorized by the country in which the flight is conducted; or
      - At an indicated airspeed exceeding 250 knots; and
    - The pilot has available in his or her logbook—
      - The completed medical examination checklist required under §68.7; and
      - The certificate of course completion required under §61.23(c)(3).



## Other Requirements

This lesson only provides an overview of what it takes to become a private pilot and the general limitations and privileges while operating as a private pilot. For more information, review the [Federal Aviation Regulations: Subpart E - Private Pilots](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=21a41358db4b248cd20cd32e85d9fdfb&mc=true&node=sp14.2.61.e&rgn=div6).



### Tips

- An aspiring pilot can start flight training at any age, but must be 17 years of age (16 for a rating in glider or balloon) to be eligible for a private pilot certificate.
- Private pilots are allowed share the costs (as long as the pilots does not pay less than the pro rata share) of a flight with passengers as long as it only includes fuel, oil, airport expenditures, or rental fees.
- Pro rata share simply means proportional in relation to the number of individuals flying and agreeing to contribute to the cost of the flight (so long the expenses only include fuel, oil, airport expenditures, or rental fees). For example, if three people agree to contribute to the flight expenses of $300, the pilot in command must not pay less than $100.
